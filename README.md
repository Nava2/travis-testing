[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nava2/travis-testing.svg?branch=cpp-project)](https://travis-ci.org/Nava2/travis-testing)

This repository contains CI configurations for [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) that I've written and used over time. It is organized by branch and language. In each branch's README, there will be a descriptiong of what is installed.

## Installed

* CMake 3.1+
* Qt 5.+
* Boost 1.59.0 (it's unfortunately installed by hand then put into `vendor/boost` and used)
* clang-3.6 and gcc
